# NAME

App::mvr - like mv, but clever

# VERSION

version 0.003

# FUNCTIONS

## mvr

Rename SOURCE to DEST, or move SOURCE(S) to DIRECTORY.

    mvr( source => 'file.txt', dest => '~/Documents' );         # move file.txt into ~/Documents
    mvr( source => 'file.txt', dest => '~/Documents/notes.txt );# move to specified name
    mvr( source => [map "$_.txt", qw/a b c/], dest => '~' );    # move multiple files into ~/

Parameters are key-value pairs:

- source

    An arrayref of source files, or a single scalar if you have only one file.

- dest

    The target pathname. If this is a directory, file(s) will be moved into it - or
    an exception will be raised if the directory doesn't exist.

- deduplicate

    Check if files are the same whenever there is a name conflict. If they are the
    same, then just remove the source file instead of adding another copy to the
    destination.

This function is not exported by default.
